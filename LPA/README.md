# 🐍 Python_Projects — Logic & Algorithms Practice

> A repo built with love, sweat, and many, many `print()`s.  
> This is where my logic training lives — from classic algorithms to brain-bending challenges 🧠✨

## 📌 About

This repository is dedicated to my learning journey in **Programming Logic and Algorithms (PLA)**, with **Python** as the main tool of choice.  
It’s a growing lab of problem-solving, creative scripts, and code experiments — made to sharpen the mind and embrace the bugs.
