# 🐍 Python_Projects — Logic & Algorithms Practice

> A repo built with love, sweat, and many, many `print()`s.  
> This is where my logic training lives — from classic algorithms to brain-bending challenges 🧠✨

## 📌 About

This repository is dedicated to my learning journey in **Programming Logic and Algorithms (PLA)**, with **Python** as the main tool of choice.  
It’s a growing lab of problem-solving, creative scripts, and code experiments — made to sharpen the mind and embrace the bugs.

## 🧠 Covered Topics

- Input/Output and data manipulation  
- Conditional logic (`if`, `else`, `elif`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- Function creation and reuse  
- Handling data collections (tuples, lists, dicts, strings)  
- Logical problem-solving and algorithm design

## 🚀 How to Use

Clone the repo and start exploring:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python_Projects.git
````

Then run the scripts locally:

```bash
cd Python_Projects
python3 your_script.py
```

## 🛠 Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Any text editor or IDE (VSCode, PyCharm, or even Notepad works!)
* Curiosity, patience, and a tolerance for the occasional bug 🐛

---

## 🌱 Always Growing

This repo is a **living notebook**. It's not polished, but it's real.  
Each folder holds fragments of understanding, mistakes turned into insights, and the rhythm of a student who refuses to give up.
