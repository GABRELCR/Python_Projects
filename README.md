## 📌 About

Welcome to `Python_Projects` — a personal laboratory of experiments, exercises, and learning paths in **Python**.  
This repository serves as a growing collection of study modules, practical logic drills, and algorithmic training designed to sharpen both fundamentals and creativity.

Each folder represents either a themed set of exercises or a complete study track in development.

## 📘 Featured Module: LPA — Programming Logic and Algorithms

The `LPA/` folder contains a complete academic-style training path following structured lessons (Aula 2–6), plus a final assignment (based on Aula 8).  
Topics include sequential algorithms, decision structures, loops, functions, and Python collections.

🔎 **Explore it here →** [`/LPA`](./LPA)

## 🚀 How to Use

Clone the repository to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GABRELCR/Python_Projects.git
````

Then navigate into any folder and run the files:

```bash
cd Python_Projects/LPA
python3 aula_2_ex1.py
```

## 🛠 Requirements

* Python 3.8 or newer
* Any code editor (VSCode, PyCharm, or Notepad++ works just fine)
* A dash of patience and a pinch of curiosity 🧂✨

---

## 🌱 Still Growing

This is a living repository. More folders, scripts, and experiments will be added as I go deeper into Python and algorithmic thinking.

Each script is a step. Each commit is a lesson.
And each bug? Well… that’s just an unpaid teacher 🐞
